           <div id="content2"> <center><p>Cherrapunjee, also known as Sohra, is a high-altitude town in the northeast Indian state of Meghalaya. It's known for its living root bridges, made from rubber trees. To the northeast, Mawkdok Dympep Valley View Point overlooks verdant gorges. In the surrounding hills, the Noh-Kalikai, Dain-Thlen and Kynrem waterfalls plunge from forested clifftops. South of town, Mawsmai Cave is illuminated to show its stalagmites.
           Sohra is located at 25.30°N 91.70°E. It has an average elevation of 1,484 metres (4,869 ft) and sits on a plateau in the southern part of the Khasi Hills, facing the plains of Bangladesh. The plateau rises 660 meters above the surrounding valleys.
           Sohra has a mild subtropical highland climate (Köppen Cwb), with monsoonal influences typical of India.
Sohra holds two Guinness world records for receiving the maximum amount of rainfall in a single year.
