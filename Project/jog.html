The second-highest plunge waterfall of India, Jog Falls is a major tourist attraction in Karnataka. Located on the border of Shimoga and Uttara Kannada districts of Karnataka, Jog waterfalls is the highest waterfall in the state.

Also known as Gerosappa Falls or the Joga Falls, these falls are one of the most important attractions in all of South India. Second, only to the Nohkalikai Falls of Meghalaya, Jog falls drops about a huge 253 m (850 ft. ) in a single fall. However, due to the construction of Linganamakki Dam, the flow in the falls is hugely restricted before monsoons.
 It is best to go in Monsoon season to see the falls in its best form.
